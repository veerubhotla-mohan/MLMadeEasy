    <h1>1. Environment Setup</h1>
    <p>
      Python is the programming language used throughout. We have many Development Environments to perform the coding. We will walkthrough 3 of them. However, we can use
      any one of them.</p>
      <h2>
        Python
      </h2>
      <p>
          The developers of Python provided an IDE called Python-IDLE to run python scripts. We can download it from <a title="" href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" data-at-href="https://www.python.org">here</a>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Head to the 'Downloads' section and download the setup file for your OS</li>
        <img class='setupImage' src='images\Python Setup\pythonDownload.png' />
        <li>Run the setup file. Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" and continue with the installation</li>
        <img class='setupImage 'src='images\Python Setup\pythonSetup.png' />
        <li>After the installation is done open Python IDLE and start coding!!! </li>
      </ol>
      <h5 class='Note'>Important: The libraries used for Machine Learning are not readily installed in Python. We need to install them manually. For that, open Command Prompt(Windows) or terminal(Linux/macOS) and install the packages using 'pip' command. Some examples:</h5>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          pip install numpy
        </li>
        <li>
          pip install pandas
        </li>
        <li>
          pip install matplotlib
        </li>
        <li>
          pip install sklearn
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
      <p>
          Jupyter is developed by Anaconda, a popular Data Science platform. We can use Anaconda platform and download Jupyter notebook. Go to <a href = 'https://www.anaconda.com/'>this</a> link and download Anaconda. The installation is straigh forward. Go ahead and install.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Now open Anaconda Navigator. Various applications will be available. Find 'Jupyter Notebook' and click on 'Launch'. If it is showing "Install" instead of 'Launch', go ahaed and install. After the installation, you'll see 'Launch'.
        </li>
        <img class='setupImage' src='images\Jupyter Setup\JupyterSetup.png' />
        <li>
          Alternatively, we can use 'Spyder' as well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h5 class='Note'>Important: Anaconda is designed for Data Science and Machine Learning. However, few packages are not readily installed except few(for example tensorflow). Most of the packages are installed. To install a package which is not installed, follow these steps.</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open 'Environments' in the Anaconda Navigator.
        </li>
        <img class='setupImage' src='images\Jupyter Setup\environments.png' />
        <li>
          A default Environment named 'base(root)' will be available. We can create as many environments as we may wish. If we want to install new package, it is better not to do it using the base Environment. Create a new Environment.
        </li>
              <img class='setupImage' src='images\Jupyter Setup\packages.png' />
        <li>
          Select the newly created Environment. Change the option in drop-down from 'Installed' to 'Not Installed'.
        </li>
        <li>
          Search for the package you want to install in the Search bar and install them.
        </li>
        <img class='setupImage' src='images\Jupyter Setup\installPackages.png' />
        <li>
          Now go to the Home of the Navigator and change the 'Applications on' tab from base to the newly created Environment
        </li>
        <img class='setupImage' src='images\Jupyter Setup\newEnv.png' />
        <li>
          Install Jupyter Notebook again in this Environment and the newly installed packages can be used now.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Google Colab</h2>
      <p>
        Colab is Google's powerful IDE for Machine Learning. There is no need of any installation to use Google Colab. All you need is a Gmail account, Google Drive and a browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open a browser, login to your gmail account and go to <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb'>this</a> link. That's it!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended to use Google Colab since it involves no installation. Everything is readily available to use.
